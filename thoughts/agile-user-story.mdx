This is a template works well for development tasks as well as general business workflows. It's great for drafting requirements. I reference it all the time.

User Story: As a [....User Role, such as Property Manager, etc....], I need the ability to [.....action / workflow needed.....], so I can [....benefit this feature will add....]
<br/>

Example: As a Property Manager, I need the ability to flag a lease as non-renewable so that I can easily keep track of which leases we don't want to offer renewals to.
<br/>

As a data migration consultant I need to the ability to import relationship status (Roomate, spouse, ect.) in the Occupant CSV as an optional field so that the consultants / clients do not need to configure this manually after migration. Other than spouse, this can be customized to the clientâ€™s needs. So the entries need to create these statuses in the system.
