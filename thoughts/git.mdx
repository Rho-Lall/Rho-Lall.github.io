A little Git goes a long way. You can get pretty deep into a development career with just the basics. This video on [Git Core Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR6G2v_WsRA) is a good starting place.
I developed a workflow based on ten lines of Git code. I learned how to deal with merge conflicts but, if you organize your work well they don't come up.
<br/>

To start:
- git status (make sure there isn't any uncommited code)
- git checkout <your development branch name>
- git pull (make sure you are working off of the most up to date code)
- clear (not needed but i like to keep my terminal clean)
- git checkout -b <new branch name, ususally a task name>
<br/>

And now You are clear to code.
<br/>

When you are ready to make a commit:
- git status (I always want to check)
- git add .
- git commit -m "<Your commit description.>"
<br/>

Commit often. I do lots of small commits and comment my process.
<br/>

Then when I am done with the task:
- git push
- git push --set-upstream origin (only needed on the first push for a new branch)
<br/>

 That's it. A crib sheet with those ten lines of code saw me through my entire development career up until . . . a couple of days ago. These are the basics. 
 <br/>

 From here forward is what i consider intermidiate Git. A couple of days ago i added four lines to my crib sheet:
 <br/>
 **F'ing Up with Git**
 - git log --oneline
 - q (to exit)
 - git reset --hard <sha1 hash listed in the git log> (the sha1 hash identifies what step you want to go back to and resets the commit history as well as your local files)
    - this overwrites any local changes you havn't commited
    - It resets (clears out) the staging area and overwrites content in the working directory (local) to what it looked like at the point of the commit identified
- git push -f origin main (for when you just want your remote to match what you have locally)
