Now the flip side is of the same question, “What would I invest my next 10 years doing? If I am spending the next 10 years developing a skil, day in and day out, what skill would that be? What would I want?

I don't know how to make this into a story, yet. A good story is like a movie, it paints a picture. If I is to make a movie about my life, a lot of that movie would be scenes of me watching Youtube. That doesn't sound very interesting. 

Nonetheless, I am watching a video of a graffiti artist on YouTube talking about the time and energy that he puts into his craft. He spent 10 years understanding the basics. Not fancy. Not complicated. Basics. 10 years. He's been studying basics. 

I heard that I and thought, “Man, I don't think I've done anything for 10 years!”

I've spent some time thinking about that and true to form I overanalyzed. I thought about it, I thought about it a lot. Yes. ;-) I am thinking about things my entire life. I'm a thinker. I just think deeply about stuff. All kinds of stuff. That's what I am doing, right? I think I'm pretty damn good thinker. 

Anyway, there's things that I am. I am a parent. I am married. What I am and what i do are not the same. This is about dedicating time and energy to an activity, a craft, or skill. Well, I’ve worked. Actually, I have added to my knowledge related to work consistently for over 10 years. Try 20. I’ve dedicated myself to a serious study of business. What I've done in business has changed over the years. The ability to adapt and change quickly learn new technologies as I implement them pays dividends. I can innovate, stay fresh, stay new. 

It took longer than it should have but after some time it hit me. Obviously, data is my bread and butter. My medium isn't a marker, pen, or paint. Data is my medium. Analysis is my craft. I’ve been doing that forever. That's my thing. That's what I spent the last 20 years doing. That is what I will do for the next 20 years. 

Now the flip side is of the same question, “What would I invest my next 10 years doing? If I am spending the next 10 years developing a skil, day in and day out, what skill would that be? What would I want? 

Storytelling. I want to be a storyteller. I want to tell stories. I realize I’m not great at it. I'm really good at thinking. I can talk alot. I'm really good at boring people as I talk. At least I recognize that. This isn’t a story, I can see that. I can see the holes and the warts. It’s a start. Gotta start somewhere.
