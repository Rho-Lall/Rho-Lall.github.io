Medieval mapmakers often noted the risk of an unknown kind by the notation “here be dragons”. 
Attempts at controlling extreme risk should come with a similar warning. 
Just like the sailors of yesteryear, financial institutions will go into unknown territories and, just like the map makers of that era, modern risk modellers have [very little to say](https://voxeu.org/article/appropriate-use-risk-models-part-i).
