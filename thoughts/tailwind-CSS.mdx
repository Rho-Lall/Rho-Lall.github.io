Difference btn rem & em:
    - em unit allows setting the font size of an element relative to the font size of its parent
    - rem is based upon the font-size value of the root element, which is the <html> element

[Order](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/order): classname='order-#'
- order is a child element that defines the order elements appear in (row vs column for responsive design)

[FlexBox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the [Grid layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
 is intended for larger scale layouts.



[Display](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/display)
: Hide an element on mobile: classname='hidden md:flex'
