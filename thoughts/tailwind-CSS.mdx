## Responsive Design
[Responsive Design Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design)
: Breakpoint Prefixes: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl

## The Holy Grail
Typical (best practice) webpage design practice. A header and footer sandwich the main content of the page. 
Often the main content will have sidebars that we can refer to as nav on the left, and aside on the right.
The areas of a webpage are header, nav, main, aside, & footer.


## Importing Fonts
[How to add a Google Font to your Gatsby Tailwind Project](https://www.itzami.com/blog/how-to-add-a-google-font-to-your-gatsby-tailwind-project)

## Difference btn rem & em:
    - em unit allows setting the font size of an element relative to the font size of its parent
    - rem is based upon the font-size value of the root element, which is the <html> element

## Page Layout

[Order](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/order): classname='order-#'
- order is a child element that defines the order elements appear in (row vs column for responsive design)

[FlexBox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
 is a tool that is most appropriate for app components, and small-scale layouts.

[Grid layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
 is intended for larger scale layouts. (And possibly data visualizations?)



[Display](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/display)
: Hide an element on mobile: classname='hidden md:flex'

## Margins & Padding

[Margin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin): The margin property controls the space outside an element, 
and the padding property controls the space inside an element.

## Sizing
[Height](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/height) : h-{number}, h-px

## Styled Components

yarn add styled-components gatsby-plugin-styled-components babel-plugin-styled-components

: MDX makes it possible to include React components in your Gatsby blog posts and pages.
