January 2016. It was curious that my endocrinologist, Dr. Amad, ordered a PET scan. Biopsy is a scary word the first time around, but not the second. 
Dr Amad took a couple of biopsies of lymph nodes in my neck. He said these could possibly explain the rise in my Thyroglobulin, but he wasn’t convinced. 
He ordered the PET scan. I asked why. His response chilled me: “Because I can’t look at your lungs with a sonogram.” 
<br/>

**Fact 1. Being diagnosed with thyroid cancer actually puts you at higher risk for other cancer.**
<br/>

I didn’t ask, “Why do you want to look at my lungs?” The answer was obvious. One cancer diagnosis didn’t mean I couldn’t have another. 
Can thyroid cancer spread to the lungs? I learned a thyroid cancer diagnosis actually puts you at a [<u>33% higher risk for other cancers</u>](http://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/vol-7-issue-4/vol-7-issue-4-p-3-4). 
The PET scan showed that there was a 2 cm nodule nestled between my trachea, lung, and a major artery. I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. I could still have undiagnosed follicular thyroid cancer, which spreads to the lungs. Three different doctors recommended surgery to remove the mass.  
<br/>

**Fact 2. Food for thought on holistic cancer treatment: Studies show that eating a diet consisting of 20% animal protein contributes to cancer growth.**
<br/>

March 2016. While preparing for surgery, I came across some food for thought on holistic cancer treatment, 
[<u>The China Study</u>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937856755&linkCode=as2&tag=aschinastudy-20&linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5). 
An experiment was originally conducted in 1968 by a pair of Indian scientists, TV Madhavan, & C. Gopalan: [<u>The effect of dietary protein on carcinogenesis of aflatoxin.</u>](http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19721301150.html) 
Campbell built on their original experiment, [<u>replicating their results.</u>](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/43/5/2150.short) 
Campbell showed that a 20% protein diet promotes cancer growth while a 5% protein diet shut it down. 
Campbell went on on to participate as a member of the China Study team. 
Praise for The China Study is impressive:
<br/>

> “The China Study describes a monumental survey of diet and death rates from cancer in more than 2,400 chinese counties and the equally monumental efforts to explore its significance and implications for nutrition and health.” 
>
> ~ Frank Rhodes, PhD 
> President Emeritus, Cornell University.
<br/>

>The China Study is the most convincing evidence yet on preventing heart disease, cancer, and other Western diseases by dietary means. 
> ~ Junshi Chen MD, PhD
> Senior Research Professor, Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety - Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
<br/>

> The China Study is a well-documented analysis of the fallacies of the modern diet, lifestyle and medicine and the quick fix approach that often fails. The lessons from China provide compelling rationale for a plant based diet to promote health and reduce the risk of the diseases of affluence.

> ~ Sushma Palmer, PhD
> Former Executive Director, Food & Nutrition Board - U.S. National Academy of Sciences.

This research gives me food for thought. There is complexity to eating beyond nutrition. I don’t pretend to understand that complexity. 
There is a social side, illustrated by this quote from Samuel L Jackson:  [<u>“How can I trust a man who won't eat a good old-fashioned American hotdog?”</u>](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010673/quotes)
There is an emotional side. We use food as a drug. We use foods to treat ourselves; we treat ourselves to ice cream. Thoracic surgery provided me with some clarity, I don’t want to do that again. For now, I’ll have that hotdog, but I don’t need one every day. 
I bought [<u>The China Study</u>](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937856755&linkCode=as2&tag=aschinastudy-20&linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5). I’m reading it now.
