## Questions to ask:   

- How is it that you have so many businesses and other people can barely handle one?
- How does your business grow while other people stay small?
- How do you have free-time when other business owners work constantly?
- Why do so many businesses start and then fail so quickly?

## The mission:

A business can have both a spiritual and a business mission to be successful, especially at the beginning. 
If the mission is clear and strong, the business will weather the trials every business goes through during its first 10 years.  
When a business gets big and it forgets its mission, or the mission it was created for is no longer needed, the business begins to die.

Many people start a business only to make money... 
The mission of a business should fill a need the customer wants. If fulfills that need well, the business will begin to make money.
When a spiritual mission and business mission are both strong and in mind, the combined power builds.
A mission must be preserved long after the entrepreneur is gone, or the business dies.

## why build a business?

**Excessive cash flow.** In his book How To Be Rich, J. Paul Getty states that his first rule is that you must be in business for yourself. 
This allows them the free time and extra money to keep investing in more and more assets, more assets tax free.

**Sell it.** For someone to be valuable, for something to be valuable, there must be many more people than you who want it.
If you can build a successful business, you will always have a lot money.
If you learn to build a successful business, you will have developed a profession that few people ever achieve. 
As a business owner, you only need to get it right . .. once.

**To build a business and take it public.** This was RD's idea of becoming an ultimate investment.

You're never too old and you're never too young.

The BI triangle outlines primary technical skills that are required as

- Vision: The ability to see what others cannot see. 
- Courage: The ability to act despite tremendous doubt.
- Creativity: The ability to think outside the box.
- The ability to withstand criticism: There is not one successful person who has not been criticized. 
- The ability to delay gratification: to be very disciplined, to learn to deny short-term and immediate self gratification in favor of a greater long-term reward.
