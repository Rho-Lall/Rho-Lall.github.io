They came up in waves. The last of the waves of people was covered in ash, head to toe. Grey matted hair, grey clothes and faces: the dead rising up out of the subway. Only thier eyes showed they had survived.

In 2001 I was an adult, but just barely. I just arrived home from my mission and needed a job. I understood that. But my mom didn’t understand that there was this new thing called the internet. I could find jobs without having to leave the apartment. My mom didn’t see it that way. I remember that fight.

My mom didn’t care. If she was outside, i needed to be outside. When I was done applying online I needed to go outside and look for work and to not come back until after she was home.

The next morning, I applied for the jobs online and prepared to make my way out the door. I made phone calls and faxed my resume to several possibilities The jobs were posted online, but I still had to fax my resume to most of them.

As I walked out the door, my dad called in a panic. He asked from my mom! He asked for my sister! He wanted to know where they were. He wanted to know if they were okay. 

I asked, “Why? What's going on?”

“You don't know, turn on the television.” 

I turned on the TV and asked, “what channel?”

Dad never answered, it didn't matter. It's was there on my TV screen. 

At that point my experience is probably similar to yours. I see tower one smoking. I see the plane hit tower two. A few minutes later I see them both collapse. From my house I can't see the World Trade Center. I can’t hear them.

When the jet fighters scream past our our building, I hear them just fine. 

The call waiting rang, my mom was on the other line. She asking for my sister! Is she okay? 

We didn't hear from my sister. Minutes became hours. My sister attended a local college by the World Trade Center. Her train passed through the World Trade Station. She was underground when the attack happened. She had no way of knowing what was going on above her.

Eventually a call came through. She was at a pay phone. She had to evacuate the train. She was okay. She was on her way but it would still be a while.

I let my parents know. I asked my mom if she still wanted me to go out and look for work. As scary as that day was, my mom is scarier. She said no, not today.

We live at the last stop of the A train. I’ve lived my share of packed train cars but it is never packed at the last stop. that day was different. I met my sister at the top of the stairs. People flooded up the stairs behind her. They came up in waves. The last of the waves of people was covered in ash, head to toe. Grey matted hair, grey clothes and faces: the dead rising up out of the subway. Only thier eyes showed they had survived.

As each wave came up a couple of brothers from Yemen who ran the corner grocery store at the top of the stairs passed out cold bottles of water. That's the kind the family they are. In the days and weeks that would follow they would be the object of anger, idle threats and inappropriate comments. But what lingers in my memory is the memory of them handing out water to strangers. Handing out water to outstretched grey hands.

That image lingers.

As does the sound of bagpipes. I still hear them. In the months that followed 911 I heard bagpipes. Every Saturday. Multiple times a day and during the week. I lived in an Irish neighborhood across the street from Good Shepard church. The bagpipes played at the funerals, many of them for first responders.

An so amidst the hashtags and calls to never forget. I’m taking this moment to reflect and to remember. To remember what was lost and what lingers on.
