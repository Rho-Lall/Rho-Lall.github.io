According to Covey, expressing your voice is a key to lifelong holistic success.

At the time I thought, maybe when I'm 40, I'll have something useful to share. Well, now I do.

As you live your life, chapters develop. Chapters will begin and chapters will end. Be mindful of when the chapters end. Take a beat. Summarize the lessons learned. Write it down. This is not the same as journaling which is capturing the experiences of the day. Journaling has its value: by all means, journal. But know that the real value is in the stories that leave an impression on your soul. What memories form the cornerstone of your character. What is remarkable? What should be remembered? What is useful? What do you want to pass on? To answer these kinds of questions a little distance is helpful.

I\\u2019ve found that when I cringe, it's actually evidence I\\u2019ve progressed as a writer. There is a delta between where I was as a writer and where I am today.
