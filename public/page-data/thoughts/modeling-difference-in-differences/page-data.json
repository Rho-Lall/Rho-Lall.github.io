The natural extension of the before and after analysis is to include a control group for comparison.  The difference in difference specification allows us to do this.

To complete a difference in difference specification we use two dummy variables that partition the sample into four groups.  The first dummy variable, treatment, partitions the sample in two halves based on their treatment status.  The second dummy variable, post, partitions the halves in quarters based on the time period.
