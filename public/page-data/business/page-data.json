But now I\\u2019ve taken time to ponder. From discomfort my feelings have transformed. Now I\\u2019m pissed.\\nSeparate the research from the politics.\\nThe research suggests that grit is not a cause but rather a correlated outcome. One\\u2019s background, not the ability to delay gratification (grit), drives long-term success. Circumstances matter.\\nAmong kids whose mothers had a college degree, those who waited for a second marshmallow did no better in the long run than those who dug right in.\\nAmong kids whose mothers did not have college degrees, those who waited did no better than those who gave in to temptation. For those kids, self-control alone couldn\\u2019t overcome economic and social disadvantages.\\nThat can all be true. Let\\u2019s go one further, it\\u2019s true. A given fact, rich kids have more advantage.\\nWhat now?\\nWhat do you tell that poor kid with the teenage mom and no dad?\\nThe Atlantic has a message for that kid. Read the last sentence of the article: for poor children, indulging in a small bit of joy today can make life feel more bearable, especially when there\\u2019s no guarantee of more joy tomorrow.\\nIt isn\\u2019t intentional. Admittedly, I\\u2019ve  taken the sentence out of context. Doesn\\u2019t matter. The subtext is there. The message is poor children are poor thru no fault of their own (true) and they are powerless to do anything about it (um . . . not true).\\nI can\\u2019t support that. The american fable is replete with examples of people who have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps. So what do you say to that poor kid with the teenage mom whose dad isn\\u2019t in his life? Give up, there is nothing you can do. Really? Do you believe that? Here is an odd thought. Instead of coming up with an answer maybe listen to what he has to say. Specifically what one such kid has to say to his own son.\\nGreatness Is Upon You\\nThis is one of my favorite people on the planet, Eric Thomas. When I\\u2019m down he is my best kept secret. I\\u2019ve watched this video countless times.\\nYOUTUBE: GREATNESS IS UPON YOU\\nIsn\\u2019t Eric talking about the exact same thing as the study? He is. It was easy for Eric to drop out of school because his dad dropped out. As did his grandfather. He hates school but, he is getting his PhD. Why? Because he understands that his son\\u2019s success is tied to his own success. Greatness is here.\\nI Didn\\u2019t Get Here By Making Excuses.\\nThe Atlantic is on some bullsh*t because the only thing you can control in this life is yourself. They are effectively taking that away. They want to feed you excuses. Will you take the bait? You will if you don\\u2019t know what you want. You owe it to yourself to know.\\nFind out what you want and then spend the rest of your natural life waking up and going after it. But you don\\u2019t want to hear that, do you? You don\\u2019t want to hear about the guy who wakes up at 2:30 in the morning to grind for the same opportunities you were given. You want to hear about 5 tips and tricks to make life easier. You want the life-hacks, not the life-hammer.\\nI was that kid. I decided I wasn\\u2019t going to be disadvantaged as a statistic but rather I was going to take the advantage with statistics. I accepted the grind, the fight, the work, to do everything in my power to press forward every single day and learn what I\\u2019m missing along the way. Because winners win. And losers lose. I didn\\u2019t get here making excuses. I wake up and I grind. No alarm clock required: my passion wakes me up.\\nI decided I wasn\\u2019t going to be disadvantaged as a statistic but rather I was going to take the advantage with statistics.\\nClick to Tweet\\nI live in America. I am a hispanic male. They don\\u2019t treat us the same, something called racism. I\\u2019m not crying about it. There will be racism until the day I die. I am not going to cry about it; I\\u2019m still going to be a millionaire. I\\u2019m still going to be one of the top data professionals in the world. No I didn\\u2019t grow up on that side of the town. My mom doesn\\u2019t have a network. I don\\u2019t \\u201Cknow people.\\u201D I\\u2019m not at a country club. I don\\u2019t play golf. I\\u2019m still going to be successful. I\\u2019m still going to get to where they are because I owe it to myself. Nobody can stop me but me.\\nTake Your Shot\\nTo succeed you only have to hit life hard one good time in the mouth. But you need to hang in there until you get your shot. When your shot comes around, take it.\\nThis week I heard the story for the first time. The time Eric Thomas learned greatness was upon him. This is his origin story. Pastor Willis takes this homeless 17 year old high school dropout and with love tells him to get his GED and go to college. He says, \\u201Cbecause greatness is upon you.\\u201D 17 years old. Living in an abandoned building. Smelly, because he doesn\\u2019t shower. Bad breath from eating garbage and not brushing after. Pastor Willis says, \\u201CGreatness is Upon You.\\u201D And now he who was admonished uses his gift to admonish us.\\nSo what do you say to the kid whose mother doesn't have a college degree? Those who wait for the marshmallow will fare no better than those who give in. Self-control alone will not overcome economic and social disadvantage. What do you say? What do you say to yourself? That kid inside you? What. do. you. say.\\nGreatness. Is. Upon. You.\\nThe Atlantic makes a classic error. Winners focus on winning. Losers focus on winners.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"March 14, 2018","title":"Push the Button","expertise":"Business","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nBegin.
