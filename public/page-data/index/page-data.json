As you live your life, chapters develop. Chapters will begin and chapters will end. Be mindful of when the chapters end. Take a beat. Summarize the lessons learned. Write it down. This is not the same as journaling which is capturing the experiences of the day. Journaling has its value: by all means, journal. But know that the real value is in the stories that leave an impression on your soul. What memories form the cornerstone of your character. What is remarkable? What should be remembered? What is useful? What do you want to pass on? To answer these kinds of questions a little distance is helpful. Give yourself some space to tell the whole story.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Overcoming cringe-worthy writing. When I read what I have written in the past, I cringe. That has held me back.

You want the life-hacks, not the life-hammer.\\nI was that kid. I decided I wasn\\u2019t going to be disadvantaged as a statistic but rather I was going to take the advantage with statistics. I accepted the grind, the fight, the work, to do everything in my power to press forward every single day and learn what I\\u2019m missing along the way. Because winners win. And losers lose.

Nobody can stop me but me.\\nTake Your Shot\\nTo succeed you only have to hit life hard one good time in the mouth. But you need to hang in there until you get your shot. When your shot comes around, take it.\\nThis week I heard the story for the first time. The time Eric Thomas learned greatness was upon him. This is his origin story. Pastor Willis takes this homeless 17 year old high school dropout and with love tells him to get his GED and go to college. He says, \\u201Cbecause greatness is upon you.\\u201D 17 years old. Living in an abandoned building. Smelly, because he doesn\\u2019t shower. Bad breath from eating garbage and not brushing after. Pastor Willis says, \\u201CGreatness is Upon You.\\u201D And now he who was admonished uses his gift to admonish us.\\nSo what do you say to the kid whose mother doesn't have a college degree? Those who wait for the marshmallow will fare no better than those who give in. Self-control alone will not overcome economic and social disadvantage. What do you say? What do you say to yourself?
